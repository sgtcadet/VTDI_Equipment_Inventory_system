# VTDI_Equipment_Inventory_system

After being tasked with the development of an IT solution for my school, The Vocational Training Development Institute, I came up with an equipment inventory system after interviewing several Lab Techs on campus. I discovered that they all had difficulty keeping track of equipment in a manual pen and paper manner. They also expressed how tedious and error-prone that method was.

The solution I came up with was a web application which kept track of all available equipment (laptops, projectors, speakers etc.) and allowed lecturers to log in and request equipment when needed.  Lab Techs can also log in, add new equipment or to view all request from lecturers; whether that request is pending, approved or closed. When an equipment request is approved, the quantity of that equipment is reduced in the system by the quantity requested and will be reserved for that lecturer at the location and time specified.
